It features six selectable classes, three game modes and a collection system which unlocks many features, including characters, skins.

## Technical

This game has a modified version of [Urho3D](https://urho3d.github.io/) that adds baked lighting based on the work of Urho3D community and [Lumak](https://github.com/Lumak/Urho3D-Lightmap) but totally different for our needs.</br>
We include shaders to emulate PSX aethetics.
